# Morphea - My own tweets search engine

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Leitmotiv

I wrote [Morphea](morphea.netlify.app) because I like Twitter a lot. I use likes ("favorites") in order to keep track of interesting content.
Often, I need to search back in my likes history to find an old (or a recent) resource. This task is complicated due to Twitter interface.

So Morphea is a simple and nice table with my tweets and search functionalities.

The name is inspired by Morpheus, greek god of sleep ("Morph√©e" in French) since all of this works without me pushing things manually.

## How

I design a full pipeline using Github Actions to have my tweets pulled from Twitter and put inside the table.

You can learn more about it by reading this blog post : [https://www.tillac-data.com/2020-search-your-tweets-with-an-automatic-pipeline/](https://www.tillac-data.com/2020-search-your-tweets-with-an-automatic-pipeline/).

## To come after that

I also plan to add two main things to Morphea :

+ my navigator bookmarks, which will need manual transfer and deduplication with tweets ;
+ add a clustering algorithm or a manual taxonomy to find things more easily.
